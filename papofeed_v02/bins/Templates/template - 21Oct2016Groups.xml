                <![CDATA[ <h1>Introduction</h1> 
                <b>About the Application</b>
                <br>The Password Policy Formalization application provides a way for users to provide password policy researchers with their interpretation of the rules contained in real-world password policies using a question-answer format. 
                <p> Because any one policy may contain a variety of rules, the set of questions asked during each policy review covers the entire password policy rule set identified by the research team. Some statements that direct user behavior are advice rather than rules. The statement, "Passwords should be memorable," is a good example of this and the questions do not cover topics such as advice. However, ample opportunity is given throughout the policy review process for users to relate any policy statements they see in the policy being reviewed.   More information on rule scope is provided in Help (found in the upper right corner of each page).
                <p> The application will present the user with a set of polices to review and will help the user track what has been reviewed. All responses to questions and comments are automatically saved, even partial responses.
                <p><b>Your Role as a User</b>
                <br>For each policy that you review, the application will present you with a copy of the policy in one browser window and the questions in another browser window. The language used in the questions and responses has been generalized to represent concepts found in multiple policies. Your task is to match the specific rules in the real world policy with the generalized responses in the question set. 
                <p><b>Required Questions</b>
                <br>Although none of the questions are required, please select all of the appropriate matches whenever possible to provide a complete representation of the policy&#39;s rules. If you are confused or don&#39;t think that the available answers are sufficient, then let us know through the optiona comment area provided on each page. There is also a general comment link (top right of each page) for any feedback or comments you may want to provide.

Formalization application</span><br>

NIST will compile participants' responses and use them to determine how
users interpret password policy statements. By analyzing the responses
of numerous participants, NIST intends to identify policy statement
wording that is clear and unambiguous and ones that are not. NIST
intends to use the results to develop a password 'grammar' that
organizations could use to write clearer password policies. Further,
single and combinations of policy statements can then be isolated and
analyzed for usability and security characteristics. The result is to
provide policy developers with guidelines to reduce user frustration
and confusion and improve compliance while improving system security.

 name="what"></a></span></b><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">What is Policy Statement</span><br>
Password policy statements typically refer to directions to users about
creating, communicating, storing, and changing passwords; as well the
consequences of failing to authenticate. There are typically four types
of statements that direct the user how to comply with the policy:
<br>
<ul>
<li>What the user "must" do</li>
<li>What the user "must not" do</li>
<li>What the user "should" do</li>
<li>What the user "should not" do</li>
</ul>

as a User</span></br>
When you use the application, you will choose a real-world password policy
from the list of policies. Once a policy is selected for review, you will be asked a series of questions about the rules contained in that policy. You should select the responses that
closely reflect your understanding of what the policy states. Some questions
may not be applicable to the policy you selected, but an response option should be available to indicate that situation. <br>

<div style="margin-left:+10px;">The scope for this project is password policy statements that pertain to general, non-privileged accounts.
As opposed to policy statements regarding a privileged account such as one that would be a system
administrator. </div><br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; padding-left:10px;">Out-of-Scope</span>
<br>
<div style="margin-left:+10px;">This
effort is directed towards password policy statements for general user
accounts, i.e., non-privileged accounts. There are a number of topics
that are out-of-scope for this
effort and questions about these topics are not included in the password
policy questions. These topics include:</div>
<ul>
  <li>Passphrases and SSH keys</li>
  <li>Password guidelines for administrators, privileged
accounts, and super users</li>
  <li>Vague statements, such as "Passwords should be memorable",
are out of scope in this effort.&nbsp;</li>

			<![CDATA[
			<br><br>
			<instructionTitle>About the Application</instructionTitle>
			<p>Welcome to the Password Policy Formalization application. This tool provides a way for users to provide password policy researchers with their interpretation of the rules contained in real-world password policies using a question-answer format. <br><br>
			On the following page are the password policies that you are tasked to review. Clicking on one of the links will bring you to the first page of the evaluation, with the policy displayed in a pop-up window.  Once the survey is successfully submitted, the application will bring you back to the policy selection screen. All answers are saved automatically, whether or not you submit the survey. In-progress surveys are noted on the policy selection page, along finished policies and those that still need to be started. <br><br>
			Because any one policy may contain a variety of rules, the set of questions asked during each policy review covers the entire password policy rule set identified by the research team. Some statements found within the policies are advice that direct user behavior rather than strict rules. The statement, "Passwords should be memorable," is a good example of this. Questions will only cover definitive rules outlined in the password requirements. However, ample opportunity is given throughout the policy review process for users to relate any policy statements they see in the policy being reviewed. More information on rule scope is provided in Help (found in the upper right corner of each page). <br><br>
			</p>
			<instructionTitle>Navigation</instructionTitle>
			<p>Page to page navigation is done two ways: the navigation buttons on the bottom of each page or the sidebar. For the navigation buttons, clicking on them will bring you to either the next or the previous page. Once finished with the last page of questions, the next page button will bring you to the submission page, where you can decide to submit or to go back. The go back button will bring you back to the first page.<br> <br>
			Each page is held within its own group of pages, and you can skip directly to the desired group or page by using the sidebar. Either click on the relevant page title in the current group, or select a new top level group to show the pages held within.<br><br>
			<center>
			<span> <img width=75% src="/static/Navigational Buttons.png" alt="Instructions Navigation Image"/> </span>	</center>  
			</p><br>
			<instructionTitle>The Policy</instructionTitle>
			<p>Once a policy is selected and the evaluation begins, the policy will be shown in a pop-up window. If no pop up appears, either contact your administrator directly or disable any ad/pop-up blockers that may be in use. If you accidentally close out of the policy before the evaluation is complete, simply move onto the next page and the policy will pop up once more.<br><br>
			</p>
			<instructionTitle>Questions</instructionTitle>
			<p>Each page will have numerous questions with types such as multiple choice, check-box, drop-down selection, and open ended comment boxes. Researchers are free to mix and match response types within a question, so some complex examples may have multiple response forms to fill out.  In certain situations, selecting a particular answer can trigger a new selection of sub-questions.<br><br>
			Most questions will require a response in order to be marked as valid. Whether it be a missing radio button answer or a blank textbox, trying to move onto the next page with an unanswered question will result in a warning message popping up. "Fix" returns you to the page with the error, while "Move On" goes onto the next page. In addition, warning icons in the form of yellow triangles <img width=6px src="/static/exclam.png" alt="Instructions Exclam Image" /> </span> will appear alongside the relevant questions. An evaluation that has missing responses can still be submitted, but the corresponding questions will be marked as incomplete. In certain cases, some questions and response sections do not require an answer and will not trigger a warning when moving onto the next page.<br><br>
			<center><span> <img width=75% src="/static/Warning.png" alt="Instructions Warning Image" /> </span> </center>
			</p><br>

			<instructionTitle>About the Application</instructionTitle>
			<p>Welcome to the Password Policy Formalization application. This tool provides a way for users to provide password policy researchers with their interpretation of the 	rules contained in real-world password policies using a question-answer format. <br><br>
			On the following page are the password policies that you are tasked to review. Clicking on one of the links will bring you to the first page of the evaluation, with the policy displayed in a pop-up window.  Once the survey is successfully submitted, the application will bring you back to the policy selection screen. All answers are saved automatically, whether or not you submit the survey. In-progress surveys are noted on the policy selection page, along finished policies and those that still need to be started. <br><br>
			Because any one policy may contain a variety of rules, the set of questions asked during each policy review covers the entire password policy rule set identified by the research team. Some statements found within the policies are advice that direct user behavior rather than strict rules. The statement, "Passwords should be memorable," is a good example of this. Questions will only cover definitive rules outlined in the password requirements. However, ample opportunity is given throughout the policy review process for users to relate any policy statements they see in the policy being reviewed. More information on rule scope is provided in Help (found in the upper right corner of each page). <br><br>
			</p>
			<instructionTitle>Navigation</instructionTitle>
			<p>Page to page navigation is done two ways: the navigation buttons on the bottom of each page or the sidebar. For the navigation buttons, clicking on them will bring you to either the next or the previous page. Once finished with the last page of questions, the next page button will bring you to the submission page, where you can decide to submit or to go back. The go back button will bring you back to the first page.<br> <br>
			Each page is held within its own group of pages, and you can skip directly to the desired group or page by using the sidebar. Either click on the relevant page title in the current group, or select a new top level group to show the pages held within.<br><br>

			<span> <img width=75% src="/static/Navigational Buttons.png" alt="Instructions Navigation Image"/> </span>	</center>  
			</p><br>
			<instructionTitle>The Policy</instructionTitle>
			<p>Once a policy is selected and the evaluation begins, the policy will be shown in a pop-up window. If no pop up appears, either contact your administrator directly or disable any ad/pop-up blockers that may be in use. If you accidentally close out of the policy before the evaluation is complete, simply move onto the next page and the policy will pop up once more.<br><br>
			</p>
			<instructionTitle>Questions</instructionTitle>
			<p>Each page will have numerous questions with types such as multiple choice, check-box, drop-down selection, and open ended comment boxes. Researchers are free to mix and match response types within a question, so some complex examples may have multiple response forms to fill out.  In certain situations, selecting a particular answer can trigger a new selection of sub-questions.<br><br>
			Most questions will require a response in order to be marked as valid. Whether it be a missing radio button answer or a blank textbox, trying to move onto the next page with an unanswered question will result in a warning message popping up. "Fix" returns you to the page with the error, while "Move On" goes onto the next page. In addition, warning icons in the form of yellow triangles <img width=6px src="/static/exclam.png" alt="Instructions Exclam Image" /> </span> will appear alongside the relevant questions. An evaluation that has missing responses can still be submitted, but the corresponding questions will be marked as incomplete. In certain cases, some questions and response sections do not require an answer and will not trigger a warning when moving onto the next page.<br><br>

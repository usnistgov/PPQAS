Writing the docx questionnaire
******************************

GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

This file describes how the docx file should be written in order to be parsed by
papo to generate a proper xml file for the Password Policy Taxonomy software.

The structure must always nest questions inside pages, which should be inside
groups.

All the IDs should always be unique. Not following this will not cause an
interruption nor a warning in papo, but will lead the Web based software to
interruption.

ID must be a number optionally followed by a point and another
number and so on ('2', '2.1', '2.1.1.1.1', '100.123.1000.1')

The parser is not sensitive to the number sequence, so IDs can appear in any
order, as long as they are unique.

Each line in the following descriptions should be a paragraph(new line) in the
docx file. Spaces and tabs in the beginning of a line will be ignored.

Bold, italics and underlines will always be directly translated into their HTML
forms, this may cause problems in some cases (e.g. page titles are translated
into links localhost/<b>page_1</b>.html).

The parser is, for now, extremely sensitive to the format.

Comments and any other kind of text in the document should not affect
the parser.

Tables insert new paragraphs between all lines and columns in the
document, which can affect the parser if used to format the question.



HOW TO BUILD GROUPS
===================

Use docx heading styles.

A docx heading level n will be translated into a level n group.

The text in the Heading is the Group Title.

Optionally, a line following the Heading (Group title) may be present and its
content will be the current group instructions.

HOW TO BUILD PAGES
==================

Use docx Strong style (do not use the Bold font attribute--only the Strong style
must be used here).

The text in the Strong style is the Page Title.



HOW TO BUILD QUESTIONS
======================

A question starts with a line beginning with 'ID:' and ends with a blank line.

format:
-------
ID: <question id>

TITLE: <question title>

TEXT: <question text>

NOTE: <question notes>

DISPLAY_WHEN: <display_when attribute>

DISPLAY_WHERE: <display_where attribute>

OPTION or TEXT (this line can be repeated as many times as wanted)

COMMENT: <additional comment question text>

OPTION or TEXT (this line can be repeated as many times as wanted)

<Blank line> #Marks end of question

NOTES ABOUT BUILDING QUESTIONS
==============================

DISPLAY_WHEN is used if the current question is to be displayed only when a
particular OPTION has been selected in another question. Indicate the ID of that
other question and its OPTION, using the SPECIAL FIELDS IDs described below.

COMMENT only applies for the last question of a page, otherwise, this label
should not be present.

OPTION and TEXT
===============

OPTION must always start with () meaning it is a radio button or [] meaning it
is a select box (multiple selections).

TEXT and the text on an option line following the () or [] may be anything in
the utf-8 range but the reserved strings and cannot be line breaks. MS Word
understands a line break every time you press <ENTER> or start a new paragraph,
it means that whenever your text reaches the end of the page and skips to the
next line, there are no line breaks.

HOW TO BUILD BNF MAPPINGS
=========================

Optionally, each OPTION line may be followed by a line:
-------------------------------------------------------

BNF: <bnf mapping statement>

This BNF will be associated to the OPTION.

Optionally, each TEXT line may be followed by a line:
-----------------------------------------------------

BNF: <bnf mapping statement>

this BNF will be associated to the current question.

SPECIAL FIELDS
==============

In the OPTION and TEXT lines, the following notation is accepted:
-----------------------------------------------------------------

[BIG_TEXT_FIELD]

Translated in text fields.


[SMALL_TEXT_FIELD]

Translated in input fields.


[NUMERICAL_FIELD]

Translated in numerical input fields.


[\|option_1\|option_2\|option_3\|]

Translated in drop down menus, accepts any number of options.


Numerical fields may optionally be followed by brackets with validations:

[NUMERICAL_FIELD]{<validations>}


Each validation must be separated by ';' and should be key value pairs
separated by ':'

[NUMERICAL_FIELD]{min:1}

[NUMERICAL_FIELD]{min:1;max:10}

The accepted validations are: min, max, text, list, length.

In the BNF lines, the following notation is accepted:
-----------------------------------------------------

[REF: <field_id>]

{[REF: <field_id>]+1}

This would add 1 to a user input in a numerical field.

Field_id is the ID of any special field described above

Ex: Users must not create passwords with more than [REF: 2.1.A.a] characters.

About SPECIAL FIELDS IDs
========================

Each option receives an ID, which is the question ID followed by '.' and a capital letter starting with A.

Each Special field receives an ID which is its option ID followed by '.' and a lower case letter starting with a.

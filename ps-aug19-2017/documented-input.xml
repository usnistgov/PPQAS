    <!-- Summary of JSON options
     {"cloze":{ ...}} - For when there is a question within the text of an option. Uses JSON format
       id – format = id of the question/option plus a lower-case letter period in between
       type – the type of input
         numerical
	 select one
	 select multiple
	 text = small text box
	 memo = big text box
       default - the default option or text to show (there may be text here which is not listed as an option)
       validation – an object which contains validation information which will be passed directly to html5 elements on the page. See this documentation https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Forms_in_HTML If the validation object contains a key "invalid_text", it will be used as mouseover text for the invalid icon, and not passed directly to the object
       option – an array of options for the user to select from (for use with either "select one" or "select multiple")

     {"insert":{ …}} – For when user input needs to be inserted into the text of a question, option, or BNF mapping.
       cref – the ID of the cloze from which this text derives.
       math - value can be any positive or negative integer - gets added to the inserted number
       count - If this key is present, cref must reference a select_multi question, and the number inserted or used in any math statement will be the number of selected options in the select multi
       qref – the ID of the question from which this text derives (e.g. when we want to insert text from a multi-choice question)
       "mod":{… – if an the option wording needs to be changed to match the bnf.
           The value of "mod" is a mapping from either cloze text or option id, to the text which should replace it. i.e. { "second (s)": "second", "minute (s)": "minute"}
       separator – when multiple options are selected, this is the text in the bnf that should separate the options.

     {"ident":[ …]} – You can use ident to swap out the answer to a question with different text. If the answer to the referenced question is equal to the option_text, then the bnf_text will be used. Also if the answer to the referenced questions is a list of things, and the option text is in the list, the bnf_text will be used.

       for when a user choice (e.g. multiple choice option) should be searched for to create a bnf phrase
       cref– the ID of the cloze from which this text derives.
       option_text – the option in the cloze that the user selects
       "option_ref" –reference number of a question’s option
       bnf_text – the text to be inserted into the bnf phrase when the before conditions are met if the bnf text is different from the option text (if no "text", then should insert the option as is)

     {"validation":…} - should not require user to answer a certain way, but only warn them. Can apply to any response, option, cloze statement, etc.
       html5 validation
       Extensions to HTML5 validation:
           gt, lt, gte, lte, eq: These options stand for "greater than", "less than", "greater than or equal", "less than or equal", and "equal" respectively. The value of any is the id of a question with an integer answer. This question will only validate if it satisfies the relationship with the referenced question. i.e. {"validation": { "gte": "q.3.2.a"}} means that this question will be valid only if its answer is greater than or equal to the answer to question 3.2.a.
